          service and the privacy policy are not visible/accessible within the app. They can be accessed by visiting the
          <a href='https://niramayaapp.com/'>app’s website</a>.It is not clear as to who has developed the Niramaya app.
          The private entity’s identity is unknown. It has been indicated neither in the website nor the app.The terms
          of service ascribes very limited liability to the developers even if correct information is provided. Also, it
          seems to absolve the developer from liability even in case of data leaks. The terms state that "[t]his
          includes but is not limited to the loss of data or loss of profit, <b>even if NIRAMAYA was advised of the
            possibility of such damages.</b>”The NIRAMAYA app, in its Terms of Service has a problematic clause
          which states:"Any material, information, or idea submitted or posted on this Web site/Mobile App will be
          considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. NIRAMAYA <b>may share or otherwise use your submission

          agree that NIRAMAYA may transmit such personal data across national and international boundaries for
          <b>any business purpose</b>.This is a problematic clause giving a blanket permission to the app
          publisher in using the data.Moreover, the policy documents use generic clauses which might suggest that the
          policy documents were ripped off from a template. This was confirmed to be true, as we found similarly worded
          provisions in the privacy policies of some websites with that of the Niramaya app’s privacy policy.</td>

          Google Play Store page.It is easy to find that the Privacy Policy was built from the Firebase app template
          which essentially is a generic template with boilerplate clauses which does not talk about how much and how

          app does not have a specific privacy policy. The Google Play Store page of the app directs a person to the
          privacy policy of <a href='https://innovaccer.com/'>the website of the developer</a>. The Privacy Policy
          therein states "This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information collected from
          including its domain and subdomains as well as any software, platform, or application owned or licensed by
          Innovaccer (collectively, the "Services").”Further, the Privacy Policy goes on to say that it is
          incorporated into the Terms of Service. However, the Terms of Service that is linked within the Privacy Policy
          govern "the use of web pages, software and content located within <a
            href='http://www.innovaccer.com/'>www.innovaccer.com</a> including its domain and subdomains and apply
          generally to any of Innovaccer’s or its affiliates’, subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ websites (collectively,
          the "Site").”Therefore, the Terms of Service technically does not apply to the "Test Yourself Goa”
          app but only to the website and associate websites of Innovacer Inc.The Privacy Policy spells out a detailed
          list of data that is collected and whether the company discloses it or sells it. As per what the current
          provisions stipulate, the company does not sell any data.However, the Privacy Policy in a clause pertaining to
          International Visitors, states that "[o]ur Services are hosted in the United States and intended for visitors
          located within the United States.” It is therefore, unclear as to why this Privacy Policy has been bundled
          with the "Test Yourself Goa” application.</td>
